abstract = {Context:
Software security patch management purports to support the process of patching known software security vulnerabilities. Patching security vulnerabilities in large and complex systems is a hugely challenging process that involves multiple stakeholders making several interdependent technological and socio-technical decisions. Given the increasing recognition of the importance of software security patch management, it is important and timely to systematically review and synthesise the relevant literature on this topic.
Objective:
This paper aims at systematically reviewing the state of the art of software security patch management to identify the socio-technical challenges in this regard, reported solutions (i.e., approaches, tools, and practices), the rigour of the evaluation and the industrial relevance of the reported solutions, and to identify the gaps for future research.
Method:
We conducted a systematic literature review of 72 studies published from 2002 to March 2020, with extended coverage until September 2020 through forward snowballing.
Results:
We identify 14 socio-technical challenges in software security patch management, 18 solution approaches, tools and practices mapped onto the software security patch management process. We provide a mapping between the solutions and challenges to enable a reader to obtain a holistic overview of the gap areas. The findings also reveal that only 20.8% of the reported solutions have been rigorously evaluated in industrial settings.
Conclusion:
Our results reveal that 50% of the common challenges have not been directly addressed in the solutions and that most of them (38.9%) address the challenges in one phase of the process, namely vulnerability scanning, assessment and prioritisation. Based on the results that highlight the important concerns in software security patch management and the lack of solutions, we recommend a list of future research directions. This study also provides useful insights about different opportunities for practitioners to adopt new solutions and understand the variations of their practical utility.}

  abstract={Software security is the idea of engineering software so that it continues to function correctly under malicious attack. Most technologists acknowledge this undertaking's importance, but they need some help in understanding how to tackle it. The article aims to provide that help by exploring software security best practices. A central and critical aspect of the computer security problem is a software problem. Software defects with security ramifications, including implementation bugs such as buffer overflows and design flaws such as inconsistent error handling, promise to be with us for years. All too often, malicious intruders can hack into systems by exploiting software defects. Internet-enabled software applications present the most common security risk encountered today, with software's ever-expanding complexity and extensibility adding further fuel to the fire. By any measure, security holes in software are common, and the problem is growing.},

abstract = {Many cyberattacks begin with a malicious email message, known as spear phishing, targeted at unsuspecting victims. Although security technologies have improved significantly in recent years, spear phishing continues to be successful due to the bespoke nature of such attacks. Crafting such emails requires attackers to conduct careful research about their victims and collect personal information about them and their acquaintances. Despite the widespread nature of spear-phishing attacks, little is understood about the human factors behind them. This is particularly the case when considering the role of attack personalization on end-user vulnerability. To study spear-phishing attacks in the laboratory, we developed a simulation environment called SpearSim that simulates the tasks involved in the generation and reception of spear-phishing messages. Using SpearSim, we conducted a laboratory experiment with human subjects to study the effect of information availability and information exploitation end-user vulnerability. The results of the experiment show that end-users in the high information-availability condition were 2.97 times more vulnerable to spear-phishing attacks than those in the low information-availability condition. We found that access to more personal information about targets can result in attacks involving contextually meaningful impersonation and narratives. We discuss the implications of this research for the design of anti-phishing training solutions.}

      Cyberattacks, via hacking, malware, spyware and ransomware infection, have become rife globally. Ransomware has, since 2013, become one of the most pernicious, destructive and prevalent of the
      many strains of malware used by cybercriminals. Strictly speaking, ransomware is malware (malicious software) using crimeware to hack into databases in order to ‘lock down’ database files so
      that the user (target victim) is unable to access the information files unless they pay a ransom. In other words, they are blackmailed to pay up by threats of either releasing the ‘captured’
      information, selling it on the Darknet to the highest bidder or the cybercriminal ransomers using personal information to hack into users’ banking accounts to steal funds from those illegally
      accessed accounts. If a victim (individual or organisation/company) refuses to pay such ransom, the files are either permanently ‘locked’ or ‘infected’ with a malware computer virus and become
      corrupted in their entirety, thus rendering future operations of the company or individual target difficult or virtually impossible. Standard ransomware was a form of malware with a more direct
      attack vector than, for instance, web-malware, and is a more-stealthy form of the older email phishing infection vehicle. The first recorded ransomware occurred in 1989. Later, more
      sophisticated versions of ransomware (after the entry of more professional cybercriminals) using encryption, appeared in 2006. But, this too, became more advanced with ransomers asking for
      greater sums of money. This ransomware, using ever-more complex encryption formats, became known as crypto-ransomware, and is a more recent and dangerous cybercriminal development. As more of
      what we do goes online, the current ransomware schemes have become more successful. New schemes are constantly being dreamed up by cybercriminals who quickly realised that people are willing to
      pay hundreds, if not thousands, in ransom (usually using the cryptocurrency Bitcoin as the medium for payment) to have their ‘stolen’ (‘locked’) information released.
