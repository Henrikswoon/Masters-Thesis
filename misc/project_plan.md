# Project plan
### Which specific questions will be answered within the scope of the project
1. Will the program described in 'Talos: Neutralizing Vulnerabilities with Security Workarounds for Rapid Response' be extensible to languages with structured error-handling such as Java?

2. Will programs in java instrumented in a similar way be able to cover a similar amount of vulnerabilities.

3. Can i discover any vulnerability created by instrumentation using Talos?
### Which methods will be used to answer these questions
Question 1. can be answered through an experiment. 

Question 2. can be answered in a similar way to the original article. Applicable vulnerabilities should be collected from an database such as nist, data should then be collected on whether these were able to be neutralized using instrumented 'software workarounds for rapid response' and if these workarounds were 'obtrusive'.

Question 3. Not sure. 

### Hur will the results found be evaluated
Results will be evaluated in comparison to the original paper.

### Which relevant literature has been identified
Talos: Neutralizing Vulnerabilities with Security Workarounds for Rapid Responds

### What will be implemented?
A version of Talos extended to be able to instrument Java.
(Should perhaps be given a name?)

### Which working method will be used
This project will use an agile methodology reviewing each sprint every other monday and setting goals based on what was achieved.

### Additional information

### Risks 
 - What happends if neccessary software is inaccessible
 > Talos was found on GitHub and has been forked to [my personal Git](https://github.com/Henrikswoon/Talos/tree/master)
 - What can be done if you don't have enough time at the end of the project
 > Not sure, since the theory part of this thesis is still a little unclear until the implementation has been finalized. Perhaps this could be discussed? 

### Agreements in supervision
The code produced should be under open source license, since TALOS uses GNU GPL this license would probably be suitable.

### Address to the journal
_Currently unavailable, will make accessible asap._
