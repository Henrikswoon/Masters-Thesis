Hi Everyone!

3rd Feb I held a presentation on the paper 'Talos:...' which this thesis will be based on. If it is of interest to you, the presentation and notes can be found here.

After having finished the presentation we discussed deliverables for the next Sprint review 16th Feb 12:30-13:00

For the next sprint review i should have hopefully finished
 - Studying Java Exceptions
 - Studying Soot
 - Studying the Talos source code.
 - Find off shelf test generators for Java
 - Find popular open source Java projects with a Test suite
 - Write a skeleton for the thesis
 - Begin writing the Background
With a presentation on these topics.

I Wish you all well, see you latest next sprint review.

With Kind Regards
Melker Henriksson
