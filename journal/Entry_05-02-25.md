## Summary. 
Today i've kept working on my research into [error handling in Java](https://github.com/Henrikswoon/Masters-Thesis/blob/main/readings/Java%20Language%20Specification%2C%20Chapter%2011.%20Exceptions/summary.md).
After Talking to Anders, i've decided to pivot from [The Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se23/html/jls-11.html) to the Java&tm; tutorials 

We also discussed 2 potential topics to research being Annotation and Instrumentation which could be coordinated.
