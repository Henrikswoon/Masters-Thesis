## Summary. 

Today has felt like a productive day. 
I am still spending a lot of time on 'configuring my environment', made a script that automatically generates the journal for the day! 
Also, began tracking coffe consumption in a spreadsheet.

I have been re-reading the article Talos which i am trying to extend. It feels like i am spending a lot of time on this but as i do i keep noticing new things which i am documenting so that i can either ask the author or my supervisors. Becoming as familiar as possible with this text doesn't seem like an issue.

Next week i should be prioritising finishing my forward snowballing analysis, making some slides for the presentation and making a formal proposal for language to extend talos to (Java).
