## Tasks completed today.
    - Made some major headway in analysing the backend for Talos

## Summary. 
Some Datatypes and Variable name meanings have been uncovered, which is great!
There is still a lot of work to do and i need to discuss to which degree i should need to understand the project. But!

Hopefully codeQL can be used to atleast partially implement the frontend!
Perhaps i can find some suitable framework for the backend as well?
