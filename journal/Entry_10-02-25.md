## Tasks completed today.
 - Learnt that '&' characters in .bib files can cause LaTeX to not compile
 - Wrote introduction until lunch
 - Researched Talos source code

## Summary. 
Today was a fairly productive day but i am worried that i will not be able to finish all my deliverables. Researching the Talos source code seems like it will be a larger task than initially planned.
