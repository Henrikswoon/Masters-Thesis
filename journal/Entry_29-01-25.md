## Summary. 
Today didn't feel particularily productive due to a lot of time being spent on setup but these things are necessary.
The meeting with Bartel and speaking to Anders at the office gave me some much needed direction, now i need to plan and act accordingly.
Tomorrow i will finish both the presentation and project plan and hopefully be able to start researching the JVM.
