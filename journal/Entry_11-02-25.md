## Tasks completed today.
    - Continued my studies on Talos source code.
        - Decided to pivot and focus on the backend rather than frontend, due to Analyser.cpp being fairly complicated.
    - Wrote some more in the introduction section 
## Summary. 
Today has perhaps felt like a less productive day. I have been trying to understand `Analyser.cpp` but it being written in c++ which i am unfamiliar with and mainly performing dataflow analysis which i am also not familiar with became a large assignment.
I pivoted after most of the day and am now focused on trying to understand the code in a less fine grained way. Would be nice to know for certain if a frontend could be built on codeQl's dataflow analysis functions.

Perhaps in the future i should define clearer subgoals than 'research source code' so that i can pivot earlier. Hindsight is 20/20.
