## Tasks completed today.
 - Held sprint review with Omegapoint supervisors
 - Wrote some regarding Jimple in the paper

## Summary. 
Tried to make CodeAnalyzer work with supervisors from Omegapoint today. Unfortunately we couldn't make it work but the strategy will be following the tutorial from scratch on a new vm and possibly installing a VM with configurations that are the same or likely to be the same as those used by Talos developers.
