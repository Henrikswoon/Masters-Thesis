## Summary. 
Today i've tried to get as much done as possible.
I was initially blocked writing the Project plan as making a week-by-week schedule seemed difficult but i was given a template schedule by Ludvig Larsson which i wil be reviewing and using tomorrow.

Otherwise i'm happy having set up my LaTeX enviroment and getting some important reading done.
