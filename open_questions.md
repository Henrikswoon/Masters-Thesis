Runtime disabling of functions?

JVM agents can be used for instrumentation? These are usually used for statistics (research this.)

in-place deployment, should users be able to themselves selectively disable certain functions through editing the configuration file? Could certainly be an security issue.

Are there any ways other than errors to redirect control flow safely?

Can a custom exception be thrown by a JVM agent? Could this take the shape of an expected exception but provide an appropriate amount of information to users.
