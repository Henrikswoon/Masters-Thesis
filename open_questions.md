Runtime disabling of functions?

JVM agents can be used for instrumentation? These are usually used for statistics (research this.)

in-place deployment, should users be able to themselves selectively disable certain functions through editing the configuration file? Could certainly be an security issue.

Does the indirect Heuristic cause an undue amount of collateral damage compared to the relative gain?

Should there be some way to ignore IDE added classes such as org.intellij.lang ?

Is referring to markets selling vulnerabilities a good way to demonstrate the demand for unpatched vulnerabilities from malicious actors? Is a source from 2005 sufficiently recent? If not can i use some other source than those i've found.
